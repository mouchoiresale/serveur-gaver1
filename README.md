# MultiOgar - Edited
Ogar game server with fast and smooth vanilla physics and multi-protocol support.

Since Barbosik stopped working on the original MultiOgar, I decided to continue it on this fork =D

Current version: **1.3.5**

## Project Info
![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-node.js-yellow.svg)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-APACHE2-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Barbosik/OgarMulti/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

MultiOgar code based on Ogar code that I heavily modified, and will continue to update. 
Almost all physics and protocol code were rewritten and optimized.
The [OgarProject](https://ogarproject.com) owns Ogar, and I do not claim it as mine! 
Original Ogar found [here](https://github.com/OgarProject/Ogar)


The goal is to make good and smooth physics and cleanup the code.

## Ogar Server Tracker

You can found active Ogar servers on http://ogar-tracker.tk 
It updates server information in realtime with no need to refresh the page.

If you want to include your server in the list. Just install the latest version of MultiOgar server and enable server tracking with `serverTracker = 1` in gameserver.ini

If you have other server and want to include it in the list, just insert the code to ping ogar-tracker.tk into your server.
You can found example in MultiOgar source code: https://github.com/Barbosik/MultiOgar/blob/master/src/GameServer.js#L1799-L1823

Version 1.2.8: 
* 1000 bots, 500 viruses, 1000 foods, map 14142x14142
* Works very-very smooth (with a little slower speed, but it will not be noticed by user).
* CPU load: 14% (x4 core)
* Memory usage: 70 MB

## Install

#### Windows:
* Download and install node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (64-bit recommended)
* Download MultiOgar code: https://github.com/Barbosik/MultiOgar/archive/master.zip
* Unzip MultiOgar code into some folder
* Start command line and execute from MultiOgar folder
```
npm install
```
and run the server:
```
cd src
node index.js
```

#### Linux:
```
# First update your packages:
sudo apt-get update

# Install git:
sudo apt-get install git

# Install node.js:
sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy npm

# Clone MultiOgar:
git clone git://github.com/Barbosik/MultiOgar.git

# Install dependencies:
cd MultiOgar
npm install

# Run the server:
cd src
sudo node index.js
```


## Clients

This lists Ogar clients and server trackers that I found on internet.

###Ogar server trackers

Welcome to http://ogar-tracker.tk :)

URL | Description
--- | ---
http://ogar-tracker.tk | Ogar tracker
http://ogar.mivabe.nl/master | MivaBe, tracks a lot of servers
http://c0nsume.me/tracker.php | c0nsume.me server tracker

Now you can allow MultiOgar to be listed on a server tracker.
Just set `serverTracker = 1` in the gameserver.ini, and your server will appear
on these pages: http://ogar.mivabe.nl/master , http://c0nsume.me/tracker.php
If you don't want to include your server to tracker list, 
just set `serverTracker = 0` and the server will not ping the server tracker.


###Ogar clients
Just replace `127.0.0.1:443` in the url to the server IP and port to play.

URL | Protocol | Description
--- | --- | ---
http://agar.io/?ip=127.0.0.1:443 | 8 | Vanilla
http://ogar.mivabe.nl/?ip=127.0.0.1:443 | early 5 | MivaBe, pretty smooth, custom graphics (anime)
http://old.ogarul.io/?ip=127.0.0.1:443 | 4 | OgarUL, old vanilla style
http://c0nsume.me/private4.php?ip=127.0.0.1:443 | 5 | Vanilla style
http://astr.io/?ip=127.0.0.1:443 | 9 | Extension like
http://alis.io/?ip=127.0.0.1:443 | 5 | Extension like
